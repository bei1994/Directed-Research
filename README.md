# Directed-Research

## Overview

During this whole summer, my research focus is on recurrent attention model. This problem involves several different topics including convolutional neural network, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural network, computer vision and tensorflow. Thus, I have studied all related fileds. The following image shows my related work:

## Recurrent Attention Model

I have researched [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5542-recurrent-models-of-visual-attention.pdf) and related papers. I totally undersatand and reproduce results in the original paper. Details and specific work please check this [link](https://github.com/bei1994/Recurrent-Attention-Model).

## Machine Learning

To have a better understading of related concepts in machine learning, I respectively took severals different online courses related to deep learning. I watched all the videos(some of them even twice) and learned all slides. 

### Deep Learning in Computer Vision

I took the course [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/) from Stanford University. Topics include: CNN, RNN, Deep Reforcement Learning, Training Neural Network, CNN architecture, Generative model, Image classification, segmentation and detecion. 

### Neural Network for Machine Learning

The course link is [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home/welcome). Topics include: Backpropagation, Generalization, RNN, Boltzmann machine, Deep Neural Net and so on.
