# Directed-Research

## Overview

During this whole summer, my research focus is on recurrent attention model. This problem involves several different topics including convolutional neural network, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural network, computer vision and tensorflow. Thus, I have studied all related fileds. The following image shows my related work:

## Recurrent Attention Model

I have researched [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5542-recurrent-models-of-visual-attention.pdf) and related papers. I totally undersatand and reproduce results in the original paper. Details and specific work please check this [link](https://github.com/bei1994/Recurrent-Attention-Model).

## Machine Learning

To have a better understading of related concepts in machine learning, I respectively took severals different online courses related to deep learning. I watched all the videos(some of them even twice) and learned all slides. 

### Deep Learning in Computer Vision

I took the course [Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/2017/) from Stanford University. Topics include: CNN, RNN, Deep Reforcement Learning, Training Neural Network, CNN architecture, Generative model, Image classification, segmentation and detecion.

## Tensorflow

I learned tensorflow through doing tutorial examples, watching videos and reading tensorflow official source. Reading source codes is very time consuming and painful. But I do get a deeper understanding through this process. The sources are listed as follows:

### Tutorial Exercises

Please check this [folder]()

## Intro to Computer Vision

This is an Intro course to computer vision, which helps me to get basic concepts in computer vision.
This is the [link](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud810).

## Matlab

I learned Matlab through videos and exercises. The [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcKDPPOF93EvvBrgR852MU13zvS2ihTpR) is here. I learned all these 47 videos. My exercises can be found [here](/matlab-exercises/).

## Summary

This is a very fruitful summer. I have learned a lot of stuff through this summer directed research involving several different topics. The processes of watching online videos and reading tensorflow source code are very time consuming. And I read many different papers which was also a big challenge to me. At the beginning, my reading speed was very slow due to many recondite concepts. Gradually I can read a paper faster. Plus, when I trained and tuned paras of my network, it was very slow due to lack of GPU. Training and paras tuning is very painstaking. I had to run it during the night and wait fror another several hours if some paras stil weren't good. Anyway, I finally got great results. 

Thank you very much for being my advisor. It is my great honor to learn with you. Thanks, prof!!
