# Directed-Research

## Overview

During this whole summer, my research focus is on recurrent attention model. This problem involves several different topics including convolutional neural network, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural network, computer vision and tensorflow. Thus, I have studied all related fileds. The following image shows my related work:

## Recurrent Attention Model
I have researched [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5542-recurrent-models-of-visual-attention.pdf) and related papers. I totally undersatand and reproduce results in the original paper. Details and specific work please check this [link](https://github.com/bei1994/Recurrent-Attention-Model).
